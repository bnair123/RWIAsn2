/*
 Token This class represents a token in the RPN notation. A token can be an operator or a number.
A TokenType enum is used to distinguish between the two. The constructor of the class takes a string
(e.g. “3” or “sqrt”), and the TokenType as arguments. If the TokenType is number, the string is parsed to
a double value in the constructor. This value can be later retrieved using the NumericValue property.
The original string is stored in the Value property.
